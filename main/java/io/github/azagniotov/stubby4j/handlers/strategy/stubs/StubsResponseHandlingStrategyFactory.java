                  The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect
                  (the original describing phrase was "Moved Temporarily"), but popular browsers implemented 302 with
                  the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to
                  distinguish between the two behaviours. However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302
                  status code as if it were the 303.
