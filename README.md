It is a highly flexible and configurable tool for testing interactions of service-oriented (SoA) or/and micro-services architectures (REST, SOAP, WSDL, etc.) over `HTTP/1.1`, `HTTP/2` and `WebSockets` protocols.

## Key features

There are a number of use cases where you'd want to use `WebSockets`, `HTTP/1.1`, `HTTP/2` stub server in your development/QA environment. If you are a `Software Engineer`/`Test Engneer`/`QA`, then it should hit close to home with you. As an example, some of these use cases are outlined below (this is by no means an exhaustive list). Use `stubby4j` when you want to:

* Dockerzied. Stub out external services in a Docker based micro-service architecture (ARM64 Docker images are also available!)
* Support for `TLS` protocol versions `1.0`, `1.1`, `1.2` and `1.3`
* Support for `HTTP/2` over TCP (`h2c`) and `HTTP/2` over TLS (`h2`) on TLS v1.2 or newer using ALPN extension
* Verify that your code makes `HTTP/1.1` or `HTTP/2` (over TLS) requests with all the required parameters and/or headers
* Support for `WebSocket` protocol over `HTTP/1.1` (with `TLS` and without) for request verification, response stubbing, server push, and more
* Fault injection, where after X good responses on the same URI you get a bad one
* Dynamic flows. Multiple stubbed responses on the same stubbed URI to test multiple application flows
* Request proxying. Ability to configure a proxy/intercept where requests are proxied to another service
* Record & Replay. The HTTP response recorded on the first call, having the subsequent calls play back the recorded HTTP response, without actually connecting to the external server
* Regex support for dynamic matching on URI, query params, headers, POST payload (ie:. `mod_rewrite` in Apache)
* Dynamic token replacement in stubbed response, by leveraging regex capturing groups as token values during HTTP request verification
* Serve binary files as stubbed response content (images, PDFs. etc.)
* Support for delayed responses for performance and stability testing
* Support for HTTP `30x` redirects verification
* Support for different types of HTTP Authorizations: `Basic`, `Bearer Token` & others
* Embed stubby4j to create a web service SANDBOX for your integration test suite
* Verify that your code correctly handles HTTP response error codes
